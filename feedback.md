You have a good start. I'd like to steer you toward using contour plots and the quiver function (it is in numpy in python and built-in in MATLAB). You should also take another look at the challenge problem in matlab - you're not actually graphing what you think you're graphing. And the 1D charged line - your calculation is only finding the electric potential on one axis. The charge distribution may be 1D, but the field is still produced in the 3D world.
